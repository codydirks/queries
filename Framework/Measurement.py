"""
The `Measurement` is a container for a `value` and `error`.

Astropy already has a very useful object, `Quantity` that is expanded into
a `Constant` class. Something with a value, a name, abbreviation, uncertainty,
and a reference. A `Measurement` is nothing more than a `Constant` by
a different name. It functions just like a Quantity/Constant, only we don't
want to be calling it a "constant" and we want to be able to have many of them.
